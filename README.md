# PyPHLAWD_WC

*PyPHLAWD_WC requires python3. This is a modified version of [PyPHLAWD](https://fephyfofum.github.io/PyPHLAWD) working with WCVP (2020) database and cluster analyses only.*  

This repo was forked from the authors' repo. We modified some functionalities and scripts to make PyPHLAWD to use the accepted WCVP species names as the tips of the reconstructed phylogenetic trees under [PhyloSynth Project](https://phylosynth.github.io/). The original [PyPHLAWD](https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/pyphlawd) is Python version of PHLAWD (Smith et al., 2009). It was developed by Smith and Walker (2019), conducting analyses either "cluster" or "bait" to construct large alignments, but PyPHLAWD_WC only does **clustering analyses** with integration of world checklist for current project purpose. You can find more information at [PyPHLAWD home website](https://fephyfofum.github.io/PyPHLAWD/). These files may also be found in the `docs` folder if you just want to check the markdown. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://fephyfofum.github.io/PyPHLAWD/install/) and run instructions can be found [here](https://fephyfofum.github.io/PyPHLAWD/runs/).
